# trusted-authorities
Repo to hold our trusted authority yaml files, as a migration from having this in the /frontend repo.

# Motivation:
Prior to MVP1, `healthcare-authorities.yaml` has lived in the [Path-Check/safeplaces-frontend repo](https://github.com/Path-Check/safeplaces-frontend).

By moving this to a dedicated repo, we can maintain our versioned lists of trusted authorities for the Safe Paths mobile app without risk of regression on commit reverts to the frontend repo.
